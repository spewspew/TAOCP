Knuth's TAOCP
=============

I am currently reading Knuthâ€™s
[TAOCP](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html) and
implementing the programs and exercises using x86-64 assembly instead
of MIX or [MMIX](http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/).

Caveat:
-------
The assembly and C is written for the [Plan 9
Operating System](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/). I use the [9front](http://www.9front.org/) fork. I have made a couple modifications to the assembler
to make assembly programming slightly easier. Ask me if you want those
changes (you will need them if you want to assemble these programs).

I have a few unix versions of the assembly code in the unix
[subdirectory](http://www.codigo.co/code/Knuth/x86_64/unix/). The GCC
assembler assembles those.
