_TAOCP_ x86-64 assembly programs on UNIX
========================================


These are written and assembled on OpenBSD which has a convenient
[header](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/arch/amd64/include/asm.h)
for writing assembly code.  If you are using Linux, you will only need
the ENTRY(routine) symbol from that header.  There is an example in
[l1.4.2.s](http://www.spew.club/code/Knuth/x86_64/unix/l1.4.2.S)
